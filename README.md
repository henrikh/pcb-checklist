# Electronics and electrical design checklist

[pcbchecklist.com]

A checklist/[trigger list] for common issues, best practices and considerations for electronics and electrical design -- from system design all the way to the user manual.

The list is being actively developed (written?) and several reorganizations will undoubtedly occur.
The current focus is mostly on adding explanations to all items.

Contributions are more than welcome!

The document is currently plain HTML with embedded JavaScript and CSS -- it keeps things simple.

A few considerations for new times:

- Place items earlier rather than later
- Encourage thinking about requirements, rather than prescribing a solution
- Give reasons and explanations
- Provide references to app.notes, books, articles etc.

Frequently Asked Questions
---------------------------

### Isn't there a big difference between analog, digital, RF etc. designs?

True. No list could cover all cases, but there is still a lot which is shared and there are many common pitfalls; all designs need to consider there test procedure; all designs need to consider mechanical integration.
Hopefully, a solid checklist can keep track of all this.

And if something is missing from whatever domain your are working in? Don't hesitate to add it to your own list or even better: contribute it this list.
